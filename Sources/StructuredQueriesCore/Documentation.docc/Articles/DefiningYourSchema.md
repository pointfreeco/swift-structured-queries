The library provides tools to model Swift data types that replicate your database's schema so that
you can use the static description of its properties to build type-safe queries. Typically the
schema of your app is defined first and foremost in your database, and then you define Swift types
that represent those database definitions.

### Defining a table

Suppose your database has a table defined with the following create statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "reminders" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT",
  "title" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  "isCompleted" INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)
```

To define a Swift data type that represents this table, one can use the `@Table` macro:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  var title = ""
  var isCompleted = false
}
```

Note that the struct's field names match the column tables of the table exactly. In order to support
property names that differ from the columns names, you can use the `@Column` macro. See the section
below, <doc:DefiningYourSchema#Customizing-a-table>,  for more information on how to customize your
data type.

With this table defined you immediately get access to the suite of tools the library provides to
build queries:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    Reminder
      .where { !$0.isCompleted }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```sql
    SELECT
      "reminders"."id",
      "reminders"."title",
      "reminders"."isCompleted"
    FROM "reminders"
    WHERE (NOT "reminders"."isCompleted")
    ```
  }
}

### Customizing a table

Oftentimes we want our Swift data types to use a different naming convention than the tables and
columns in our database. It is common for tables and columns to use "snake case" naming, whereas
Swift is almost always written in "camel case." The library provides tools for you to define your
Swift data types exactly as you want, while still being adaptable to the schema of your database.

#### Table names

By default the `@Table` macro assumes that the name of your database table is the lowercased,
pluralized version of your data type's name. In order to lowercase and pluralize the type name the
library has some light inflection logic to come up with mostly reasonable results:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {}
@Table struct Category {}
@Table struct Status {}
@Table struct RemindersList {}

Reminder.tableName       // "reminders"
Category.tableName       // "categories"
Status.tableName         // "statuses"
RemindersList.tableName  // "remindersLists"
```

However, many people prefer for their table names to be the _singular_ form of the noun, or they
prefer to use snake case instead of camel case. In such cases you can provide the `@Table` with a
string for the name of the table in the database:

```swift
@Table("reminder") struct Reminder {}
@Table("category") struct Category {}
@Table("status") struct Status {}
@Table("reminders_list") struct RemindersList {}

Reminder.tableName       // "reminder"
Category.tableName       // "category"
Status.tableName         // "status"
RemindersList.tableName  // "reminders_list"
```

#### Column names

Properties of Swift types often differ in formatting from the columns they represent in the
database. Most often this is a different of snake case versus camelcase. In such situations you can
use the `@Column` macro to describe the name of the column as it exists in the database in order
to have your Swift data type represent the most pristine version of itself:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  var title = ""
  @Column("is_completed")
  var isCompleted = false
}
```

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    Reminder
      .where { !$0.isCompleted }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```sql
    SELECT
    "reminders"."id",
    "reminders"."title",
    "reminders"."is_completed"
    WHERE (NOT "reminders"."is_completed")
    ```
  }
}

Here we get to continue using camel case `isCompleted` in Swift, as is customary, but the SQL
generated when writing queries will correctly use `"is_completed"`.

### Custom data types

StructuredQueries provides support for many basic Swift data types out of the box, like strings,
integers, doubles, bytes, and booleans, but you may want to represent custom, domain specific types
with your table's columns, instead. For these data types you must either define a conformance to
``QueryBindable`` to translate values to a format that the library does understand, or provide a
``QueryRepresentable`` type that wraps your domain type.

The library comes with several `QueryRepresentable` conformances to aid in representing dates,
UUIDs, and JSON, and you can define your own conformances for your own custom data types.

#### RawRepresentable

Simple data types, in particular ones conforming to `RawRepresentable` whose `RawValue` is a string
or integer, can be held in tables by conforming to the ``QueryBindable`` protocol. For example,
a priority enum can be held in the `Reminder` table like so:

```swift
@Table
struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  var title = ""
  var priority: Priority?
}
enum Priority: Int, QueryBindable {
  case low, medium, high
}
```

The library will automatically encode the priority to an integer when inserting into the database,
and will decode data from the database using the `RawRepresentable` conformance of `Priority`.

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    Reminder.insert(
      Reminder.Draft(
        title: "Get haircut",
        priority: .medium
      )
    )
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO "reminders"
      ("date", "priority")
    VALUES
      ('Get haircut', 2)
    ```
  }
}

#### JSON

To store complex data types in a column of a SQLite table you can serialize values to JSON. For
example, suppose the `Reminder` table had an array of notes:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  var title = ""
  var notes: [String]  // ðŸ›‘
}
```

This does not work because the `@Table` macro does not know how to encode and decode an array
of strings into a value that SQLite understands. If you annotate this field with
``Swift/Decodable/JSONRepresentation``, then the library can encode the array of strings to a JSON
string when storing data in the table, and decode the JSON array into a Swift array when decoding a
row:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  var title = ""
  @Column(as: [String].JSONRepresentation.self)
  var notes: [String]
}
```

With that you can insert reminders with notes like so:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    Reminder.insert(
      Reminder.Draft(
        title: "Get groceries",
        notes: ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bananas"]
      )
    )
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO "reminders"
      ("title", "notes")
    VALUES
      ('Get groceries',
       '["Milk","Eggs","Bananas"]')
    ```
  }
}

#### Default representations for dates and UUIDs

While some relational databases, like MySQL and Postgres, have native types for dates and UUIDs,
SQLite does _not_, and instead can represent them in a variety of ways. In order to lessen the
friction of building queries with dates and UUIDs, the library has decided to provide a default
representation for dates and UUIDs, and if that choice does not fit your schema you can explicitly
specify the representation you want.

##### Dates

Dates in SQLite have 3 different representations:

  * Text column interpreted as ISO-8601-formatted string.
  * Int column interpreted as number of seconds since Unix epoch.
  * Double column interpreted as a Julian day (number of days since November 24, 4713 BC).

By default, StructuredQueries will bind and decode dates as ISO-8601 text. If you want the library
to use a different representation (_i.e._ integer or double), you can provide an explicit query
representation to the `@Column` macro's `as:` argument. ``Foundation/Date/UnixTimeRepresentation``
will store the date as an integer, and ``Foundation/Date/JulianDayRepresentation`` will store the
date as a floating point number.

For example:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  @Column(as: Date.UnixTimeRepresentation.self)
  var date: Date
}
```

And StructuredQueries will take care of formatting the value for the database:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    Reminder.insert(
      Reminder.Draft(date: Date())
    )
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO "reminders"
      ("date")
    VALUES
      (1517184480)
    ```
  }
}

If you use the non-default date representation in your schema, then while querying against a 
date column with a Swift Date, you will need to explicitly bundle up the Swift date into the 
appropriate representation to use various query helpers. This can be done using the `#bind` macro:

```swift
Reminder.where { $0.created > #bind(startDate) }
```

> Note: When using the default representation for dates (ISO-8601 text) you do not need to use
> the `#bind` macro:
> 
> ```swift
> Reminder.where { $0.created > startDate }
> ```

##### UUIDs

SQLite also does not have type-level support for UUIDs. By default, the library will bind and decode
UUIDs as lowercased, hexadecimal text, but it also provides custom representations. This includes
``Foundation/UUID/UppercasedRepresentation`` for uppercased text, as well as
``Foundation/UUID/BytesRepresentation`` for raw bytes.

To use such custom representations, you can provide it to the `@Column` macro's `as:` parameter:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  @Column(as: UUID.BytesRepresentation.self)
  let id: UUID
  var title = ""
}
```

If you use the non-default UUID representation in your schema, then while querying against a UUID
column with a Swift UUID, you will need to explicitly bundle up the Swift UUID into the appropriate
representation to use various query helpers. This can be done using
the `#bind` macro:

```swift
Reminder.where { $0.id != #bind(reminder.id) }
```

> Note: When using the default representation for UUID (lower-cased text) you do not need to use
> the `#bind` macro:
> 
> ```swift
> Reminder.where { $0.id != reminder.id }
> ```

### Primary keyed tables

It is possible to tell let the `@Table` macro know which property of your data type is the primary
key for the table in the database, and doing so unlocks new APIs for inserting, updating, and
deleting records. By default the `@Table` macro will assume any property named `id` is the
primary key, or you can explicitly specify it with the `primaryKey:` argument of the `@Column`
macro:

```swift
struct Book {
  @Column(primaryKey: true)
  let isbn: String
  var title = ""
}
```

If the table has no primary key, but has an `id` column, one can explicitly opt out of the
macro's primary key functionality by specifying `primaryKey: false`:

```swift
@Column(primaryKey: false)
var id: String
```

See <doc:PrimaryKeyedTable> for more information on tables with primary keys.

### Ephemeral columns

It is possible to store properties in a Swift data type that has no corresponding column in your SQL
database. Such properties must have a default value, and can be specified using the `@Ephemeral`
macro:

```swift
struct Book {
  @Column(primaryKey: true)
  let isbn: String
  var title: String
  @Ephemeral
  var scratchNotes = ""
}
```
